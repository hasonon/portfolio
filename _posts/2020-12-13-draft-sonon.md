Instant gratification is a concept that I’m sure rings a familiar tune with some people. It is the desire to have things now, to experience pleasure sooner rather than later. The average person is hard-wired to look for instant gratification. In the wild, where survival wasn't assured and resources were scarce, concepts like long-term planning take less precedence. You don't know when you'll next get the chance to eat, so eat the food already before it spoils. Even now, despite the fact that long-term planning is more important than ever, we still haven't gotten rid of the instincts that we got from our earlier days of being hunter-gatherers.

**Pick between succeeding two.**

I’m sure that procrastination is not a rare sight for some of us, but a daily struggle. I’m also sure that it can be a source of dismay, disappointment, and self-doubt, but don’t feel too bad. You’re going up against your own self-destructive tendencies, as well as their enablers. Put simply, we are not alone in knowing about instant gratification. The companies and corporations behind many services know and utilize instant gratification for their own needs, creating environments that are designed to suck us in and leave us using services for hours.

While I could go on and talk about how we can combat our instinct for instant gratification, I would like to talk about something else. As a student who's done some research into machine learning, I'd like to talk about the other end of the instant gratification chain: the enablers. Put simply, we are not alone in knowing about instant gratification. The companies and corporations behind many services know and utilize instant gratification for their own needs, creating environments that are designed to suck us in and leave us using services for hours.

As a student who’s dabbled in and is familiar with the concept of machine learning, algorithms, and data science, I feel that I am somewhat qualified to discuss this topic. Algorithms form the backbone of the modern-day internet. Many of the services you use on a daily basis utilize algorithms to increase usage and collect a frankly terrifying amount of data to do this. Every show you’ve watched, every rating you give, every video you like/dislike, every channel you’ve subscribed to, and so much more. Your behavior is constantly compared to others’ to give you the best recommendations they can possibly give in a process that’s constantly being researched and improved upon each day.

The end goal? To maximize usage and viewing hours. For a service like Netflix and, especially, Youtube, a consistent watcher is consistent income. The more you use a service, the more likely you’ll keep using it, the more money they get. The problem here is that we have a limit on how much Netflix/Youtube is desirable. We don’t want to spend all-day reading funny internet articles or watching videos, but these entities do and take advantage of our innate desire for instant gratification to do so.

Entertainment has adapted to the influx of digital technology with aplomb. Digital media offers a platform that can stimulate our monkey brains unlike any other. Content is easily accessible, practically endless, and virtually limitless in types and genres. Algorithms streamline the process even further by giving you easy access to what you’ll probably like, and once you finish, the next episode/article/post is just a click away.

From this perspective, modern entertainment is practically engineered. It has been min-maxed to a degree the likes of which has not been seen before. Where in the past, entertainment was limited by the distribution and availability of magazines and books, now, it is merely limited by which service and Internet pack you can afford. Procrastination is seen as a bad habit (for good reason), but one can say that the odds were stacked against us from the start. We are not only fighting against ourselves, but also the dozens or hundreds of bots and humans that are working to keep us distracted and entertained.

Environments have been engineered to entertain us endlessly. Such is the nature of the Internet. Such is the nature of our monkey brains.
