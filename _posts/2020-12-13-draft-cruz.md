As someone who has seen an ungodly amount of anime, I have seen plenty of genres within the medium. Anime tends to be a gateway for us to see amazing fantasy worlds with deep lore, intricate worldbuilding, interesting characters experiencing extraordinary situations, and plenty of hype-inducing action scenes. This can be observed from mainstream anime like Naruto, Pokemon, Dragon Ball, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Attack on Titan. 

Of course, most people are aware of these action-packed anime shows. What most people don’t know though, is that not all anime shows are about action, drama, and adventure. There are also some that are literally only about the daily lives of the characters. This is the slice of life genre. There’s never anything grandiose like saving the world or going on an epic adventure. 

Now, you might ask, why would people animate something this ordinary? Why would so many people want to watch people living their mundane lives? Well, it’s simple. Slice of life anime is enjoyed by people because it is made to be relatable and easy to digest, and puts a greater focus on character interactions and development than creating a compelling narrative. The lack of a deep plot allows for character interactions to play out organically as there isn’t any story reason or circumstance that forces characters to interact. Of course, to compensate for the lack of story, all creative thinking goes into making the characters as likeable and appealing as possible.

To further understand the appeal of the genre, let’s take a closer look at Lucky Star, one of the most popular slice of life shows in the anime industry, voted the 205th most popular anime by the users of MyAnimeList. Lucky Star, for all intents and purposes, has no overarching plot. It is just a series of anecdotes about the main cast which consists of mostly high school girls just living their lives. To someone who hasn’t seen any pure slice of life shows, this may seem basic and shallow. But, despite that, it still became one of the most well-known anime shows in the world. So, why would people want to watch something as shallow as that? Going back to my point from earlier, it’s all because of the characters.

Characters in shows like these are typically designed to be archetypes of people we usually see in real life. In Lucky Star, there’s Konata, who’s a huge geek and a hardcore gamer, there’s Kagami who acts mature but opens up to her close friends, there’s Tsukasa who’s a typical pure and innocent girl, there’s Miyuki who’s rich and book-smart, but also airheaded, and many more characters. All of these characters have great chemistry with each other and their interactions are often relaxing to watch, no matter how basic they may get. In fact, the first episode literally opens up with them having a conversation on the best way to eat a chocolate cornet and it was still pretty interesting to watch. A very strange way to hook your audience in, but it works for people with the right mindset for watching shows like these. 

It is also important to note that slice of life anime is by no means low energy. It usually still maintains the expressive, exaggerated, and lively tropes and influences popularized by most of the mainstream action anime, bringing a unique flavor and vibe to the characters’ everyday lives.

In conclusion, watching slice of life anime is like hanging out with friends. It feels wholesome, down to earth, relatable, and overall a relaxing time. There’s minimal drama, tension, or fighting. It doesn’t matter that we’re just watching the daily lives of people, because we are invested in the people themselves. Sometimes, people don’t want an epic story, they don’t want to see a constant barrage of plot twists. Sometimes they just want a wholesome and relaxing time.
