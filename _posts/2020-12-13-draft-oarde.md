Way back in their conception, games were simply a way to entertain one’s self--to pass the time. And though I would be using video games for the rest of this speech, everything I say can also be the case for board games, card games, or any other kind of game there is. Games, like other entertainment media, had the sole purpose of being enjoyed. However, throughout its existence, the medium has grown from being a shallow source of fun, to a medium capable of expressing a deeper, profound message--a characteristic that defines art. This potential is what I would like to discuss today.
    
Before we go into that though, the definition of art that I would like to go by is a spin on Oxford’s primary definition, that “\[art is\] the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination… producing works to be \[experienced or\] appreciated...for their beauty or emotional power”. As a person who frequently dabbles in these media, I say that games are art because they are manufactured and designed experiences that have the potential for emotional impact--let me explain that further.

First, games are designed, appreciable interactive experiences. Games, after being designed by their creators, are meant to provide sets of new and different experiences to players. But just how these said experiences are presented is where games differ from other media. Unlike reading and watching which are passive entertainment media, video games demand actively learning and interacting with the in-game mechanics to progress. If you look at reviews of games like PS4’s “Spiderman”, a ton of them would say that it makes you feel like Spiderman (Dornbush, 2018). This active participation or ‘choice’ provides the possibility for a more intimate connection with and appreciation of the story and gameplay.

And second, games--as a medium--have the potential to deliver a message intertwined with its unique feature of interactivity. For example, the medium of film is nowadays generally considered an art form. They however weren’t always deemed as such, back in the medium’s infancy they were seen more as a novelty. Apparent by their nickname ‘moving picture’, film had no distinct identity back aside from its contemporaries. Film, however, introduced a more complex form of audio-visual experience. And with this, it eventually was used to portray intimate, emotional, and thought-provoking ideas that were only accessible due to the nature of the medium. Like film before it, the game medium was and sometimes still is, dismissed as childish. But just like how its predecessor did, it can use the new avenue of choice and interactivity to dive deeper and create or hint at a more metaphorical meaning within its mechanics--and sure enough, that’s being done by developers. Take the 2018 platformer “Celeste”, wherein the in-game mechanics and story of climbing a mountain allude to overcoming anxiety. You could cite the 2020 indie game “Perfect Vermin”, whose mechanics and story serve as a metaphor for cancer and substance abuse, or even how the aforementioned role-playing game Undertale tells a story about empathy through its mechanics and characters. Countless more games could be cited as proof that games are a unique, interactive art form that has the potential to deliver a profound message about the human condition.

In conclusion, games can be art. I believe that throughout its continued existence as a medium, despite the growth and opposition it needs to overcome, it--just like films or comics before it--has the potential to be a unique art form. One characterized by player choice, and one capable of being a profound carrier of deeper meaning.
